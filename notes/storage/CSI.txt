Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

- Standart that defines how an orchestration solution (like k8s) would
comunicate with a container runtime like Docker. This is intented to
allow OSS. When a new container runtime is developed it just needs 
to follow the CRI guidelines to so that k8s can use it.


Container Network Interface (CNI)

- Same as CRI, but for Networks. Networking vendors can simply develop
their plug in so its readily used by k8s.

Container Storage Interface (CSI)

- Created to support multiple storage solutions. You can write your own
drivers for storage in k8s.
