Authorization 

Def: Once a user has acess, what can they do


Mechanisms:

  node: NodeAuthorizer - kubelet uses this


  Attribute Based Auth (ABAC): - Assosiate a user or group with a set of permissions 
                               - Create policy file that specifies this



  Role Based Auth (RBAC): Easier than ABAC. Instead of associating a user or group with a set of permissions, we give them a role. Hence this role has a set of permissions and then we associate the users or group with the role.


  Webhook: useful to outsource all authorization mechanisms



Modes:

  - AlwaysAllow	- allows all requests
  - AlwaysDeny - denies all requests
