Can use several tools. For example openssl



We first need to create the local ca certificates by generateing a private key and an CSR

1 - generate private key using - openssl genrsa -out ca.key

2 - generate CSR - openssl req -new -key ca.key -subj .... 

3 - Sign certs using - openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -signkey ca




CLIENT CERTS

1 - same first step as above 

2 - CSR as well with "/CN=kube-admin" - we can distinguish an admin from a general user by adding the 
/O=system:masters paramter to the previous CN command. Its a group that k8s has that identifies admins
by using this, then the admin cert will have the group in there, authenticaing themselves as admins

3 - generate sign certificates using openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out admin.crt

we are signing the client cert with the CA cert and key pair, making it a valid cert
