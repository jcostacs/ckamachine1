TLS certificates ensure that the communcation between two entities is secured. 

For example when a user tries to  acesse a web server, TLS certs ensure that the communcation
is encrypted, and the server is who says he is.

Asymmetric encryption uses both a private and public key. Private key stays on the user
 while the public anyone can have.

you encrypt the data with the public key and only the private key can unlock it.

public key is used to lock data for the private key to unlock it.



SSH example

ssh-keygen will generate two keys. the public key stays on the server where you want to ssh into

secure the server by only be acessible (works as a lock then) with that public key

add the public key on the sv with cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


A certficate is sent by the server to the user and identifies the server has having the expected 
public key


most important part of a cert is who signed the cert. Thats what validades it

CA stands for Certified Authority and is a recognized entity who signs the certificate

web browsers check these certs 

send a CSR ( Certificate Signing request) with openssl for example so that you can request the CAs to sign it

CAs are authenticated by using private keys to public keys already built in the browsers


the entire infrasctructure including the CA, the servers, the people, the processes  in charge of generating, distributing and
maitaining certs is called Public Key Infrastucture (PKI)
