1 - Already have the user.csr - first we need to create the CSR within k8s (look for CSR)

  		- get the csr and encode to base64 to edit the csr.yaml file with that encoded csr

      - create the csr yaml

2 - get that approved ( so we have the user in the system)

3 - Create role and role binding with the previliges 



4 - verify the access

      - k auth can-i something something -n xxx --as user
