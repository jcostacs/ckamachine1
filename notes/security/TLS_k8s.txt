In k8s the objective is for all servers to use sv certs and for all clients to use client 
certs

SERVER COMPONENTS

kube-apiserver for example will need to generate a apiserver.crt and a apiserver.key
aka a public and private key

etcd server likewise

kubelet server "


CLIENT COMPONENTS

Its us, admins that use kubectl or using the REST API

admin user will need a client cert and private key

kube-scheduler as well

kube-controller-manager as well

kube-proxy as well


only kube-api server talks to etcd server (from etcd POV kube-apisv is a client)
kube-api can use the same server certs or use new client certs to authenticate towards 
etcd server

kube-api sv also talks to kubelet server. Can also use the same server certs or create 
client certs just to communicate with the kubelet.
