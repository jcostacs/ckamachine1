Security Contexts 



Its posible to add security parameters to a docker container when
you run it, such as docker run --user=xxx and even add linux capabilities


In k8s you can configure this as well:

Can configure at Container level or Pod level

	- Within Pod level, it acts as global security options for all 
containers
	- The container level security overrides the Pod level one



field for Pod is:

spec: 
  
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: XXX

for container, just move the section to the container spec

    securityContext:
       runAsUser: XXX
       capabilities: 
         add: ["MAC_ADMIN"]


kubectl exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami ----- will tell you what is the 
user that is running the container
