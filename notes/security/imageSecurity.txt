Secure Image Repos


image: nginx -> image/repo follows docker image convention

       when only using nginx its actually library/nginx which refers to the user or account name

       library -> dockers default images


this images are stored in a registry:

  image: docker.io/library/nginx 
 
  gcr.io is from google
 
  all public

so for a private application, using a private registry/repo is the best practice



Private Repo

1 - substitue the image with the full path of the image's private registry

2 - to login into the private registry, we create a secret for it

    kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=XXX --docker-username=XXX --docker-password=XXX 
    
    --docker-email=xxx


3 - Use imagePullSecrets in the containers section to specify the secret

containers: 
  - name: xxx
    image: xxxx

imagePullSecrets: 
 - name: XXX
