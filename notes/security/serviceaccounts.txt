Service Accounts


2 types of accounts:

	User accounts: used by humans

	Service account: used my machines - like app interacting with the cluster such as Prometheus and Jenkins


To create a SA use: kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard-sa

			  kubectl get serviceaccount

			  kubectl describe serviceaccount xxxxx


when SA is created it first creates the SA object and then generates the token for the SA

then it creates a secret to store the token inside the secret object. Then thye are linked 



to view the token: kubectl decribe secret xxx 


If Jenkins is ran inside the k8s cluster, then its simpler. You can automatically mount the service account token secret
as a volume inside the pod hosting Jenkins.


to modify the SA used by a pod we need to a add to the yaml file:

.
.
.
spec: 

 containers:
 - name: xxx
   image: xxx

 serviceAccountName: xxx


must delete and re-apply pod

k8s automatically mounts the default SA if you havent explicit specified any. You can disable this
by specifying it in the yaml

.
.
.
spec: 

 containers:
 - name: xxx
   image: xxx

 serviceAccountName: xxx
 
 automountServiceAccountToken: false
