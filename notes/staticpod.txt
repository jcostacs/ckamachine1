Static POD

Not dependent of the master node (sheduler and API). The kubelet on the worker node is what takes care of keeping that static pod
alive. 
 
yaml has to be on a specific path, configured in kubelet.service to create a static pod. Sheducler will ignore those yaml files
singlehandedly by the kubelet. Only way to delete it is deleting the yaml file


ps -aux | grep kubelet to find the config path

kubectl run  --restart=Never --image=xxx --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > path
