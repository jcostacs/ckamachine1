- DNS resolution in the cluster (internal) - it helps pods resolve IPs/Names
inside the cluster


SERVICES:

- Whenever a service is created, a record on the DNS server is created 
that maps the hostname and the IP address of the same


- If not on the same NS, you cannot simply use the name of the service 
but curl http://<service_name>.<ns>

- Additionally to hostname,NS and IP address, the DNS entry also has the 
service type and the root. Basically all the services are group together
on another sub-domain called svc (for example). And then all the services
and pods are grouped together under a root domain.

- So you can access the service with the full concatenation of the domains



PODS:

- records for pods are not enabled by default

- hostname is the IP but instead of dots (.), dashes (-) are used

- difference is the Type domain - instead of svc it's type pod


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, if we wnated to inform a pod how to reach another pod, we would
add an entry on /etc/hosts with the name and IP of the pod to reach.

To avoid having entries for every pod on the cluster, k8s uses a DNS server
with that information. Hence, on /etc/resolv.conf on the pod we just need 
to have the name of the DNS server with its IP.

CoreDNS - DNS server deployed as a pod on the control-plane NS

coreDNS uses a Corefile found in /etc/coredns with plugins definitions and
configuration.
