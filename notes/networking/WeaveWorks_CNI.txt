WeaveWorks Weave CNI plugin


Deployed as a daemonSet (agent) in order to have easy and automatic
routing (and not only) to have effective k8s networking.




ps -ef | grep kubelet -> to know the networking plugin being used

/opt/cni/bin -> to look at the available plugins bins for CNI

/etc/cni/net.d/ -> look at the used plugin

IPAM - IP Address Management

How are the virtual bridge networks in the nodes assigned an IP subnet
How are the pods assigned an IP 

CNI must manage IP address assignment to pods

CNI comes with two bulti in plugins to manage the IPS:
   - host-local plugin
   - DHCP
Still needs to be called on the script

Different networking solutions providers will do this on its own way, 
like weaveworks:

- By default allocates 10.32.0.0/12 for IP assignment on the entire network



IMPORTANT

Q: Check network solution on cluster:

A: we check the parameters on kubelet
   ps aux | grep kubelet

   we check for the network_plugin=cni
   
   /etc/cni/net.d/FILE



Q: Identify the bridge created by weave

A: ip link

   or 

   ssh intonode
   ip link --- look for weave




Q: IP range

A: look at logs on the weave pods
   kubectl logs POD_WEAVE_NAME CONTAINER_NAME
   look for range



Q: Default gateway for pods on X node

A: test by running pod
   k run busybox --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml -- sleep 1000 > asda.yaml
   insert under spec:
                  nodeName: node01
   apply the yaml

   go into the pod to list the routing table
   k exec busybox -- ip route 
   look at default gateway
