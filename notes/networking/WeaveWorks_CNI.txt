Deployed as a daemonSet (agent) in order to have easy and automatic
routing (and not only) to have effective k8s networking.




ps -ef | grep kubelet -> to know the networking plugin being used

/opt/cni/bin -> to look at the available plugins bins for CNI

IPAM - IP Address Management

How are the virtual bridge networks in the nodes assigned an IP subnet
How are the pods assigned an IP 

CNI must manage IP address assignment to pods

CNI comes with two bulti in plugins to manage the IPS:
   - host-local plugin
   - DHCP
Still needs to be called on the script

Different networking solutions providers will do this on its own way, 
like weaveworks:

- By default allocates 10.32.0.0/12 for IP assignment on the netire network
