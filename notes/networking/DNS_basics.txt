DNS for beginners 


cat >> /etc/hosts will allow to set DNS entry (a name for a known IP)


Host A doesnt check if the Host B name is actually XX. The /etc/hosts
path is a source of absolute truth.

You can have as many names as you want for a single IP addr


All those entries were moved to a server (DNS server) that manages 
and updates the entries of IPs vs hostnames. So we point all the hosts
to connect to the DNS so it figures which actual machine are we 
trying to connect to

If DNS-IP is 192.168.1.100
we can specify this entry on the /etc/resolv.conf file 
nameserver        192.168.1.100



if there is a mismatch on the /etc/hosts file and on revolv.conf file, 
it follows the hosts file. That order be changed on /etc/nsswitch.conf


for instance, we can point the host to always reach googles DNS server
8.8.8.8

nameserver 8.8.8.8



. -> Root

.com .net .edu .org -> top level domain

Top level domain Name -> .com google

Subdomain -> wwww maps drive



When the DNS does not know the name it asks the next DNS server (per 
hierarchy of domains)

so by querying apps.google.com
1 - Org DNS (does not know, and asks)
2 - Root DNS
3 - .com DNS
4 - Google DNS


on /etc/resolv.conf:

search      mycompany.com prod.mycompany.com

The search appends a domain name to the subdomain you tried to reach
for. 
ping web will try to web.mycompany.com
can have multiple searches


nslookup to query a hostname from a DNS server. But nslookup does not
consider entries in the local /etc/hosts file. Only queries the DNS
server.
