Pod Networking


On top of the cluster network we also have another layer of
networking for pods to communicate to each other

Model:
- Every pod should have an IP address
- Every pod should be able to ocmmunciate with every other
pod in the same node
- Every pod should be able to communicate with every other
pod on other nodes without NAT


Following the netns method:
- We create bridge networks on each node
- then we bring them up
- assign IPs to bridge interfaces (each bridge is its own 
private subnet)
- set IP address for the bridge interface
- script to auto attach the newly created container to the
bridge


How to reach other pods on other nodes:
- add route on node1 routing table to reach podIP on node2 via
node2 host network interface
# ip route add 10.244.2.2(pod to be reached) via 192.168.1.12
(node2)

- to do this to all pods and nodes we should have a router
to point all hosts to use the router has the default network

- This way we create a big subnet netowrk that connects all
bridges together


CNI mandates how k8s should call the net-script script as soon
as pod is created. CNI tells how the script should look like
