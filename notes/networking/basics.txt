Networking basics - Linux


A switch serves the purpose to connect machines together -> the switch
creates a network (192.168.1.0) that contains both systems

interface (NIC): ip link command

assigning the hosts IPs to the newly created network we have to

ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eht0

after this the PCs can now communicate via the switch


How to reach other networks? Routing

the router (another server with many network ports) connects 
2 networks together 


Gateway - door to the outside world (internet) 

the systems need to know where this gateway is.


route command - it will display the existing routing configurations

To configure the gateway:

ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
where

192.168.1.1 - router IP(gateway/door) from system A
192.168.2.0 - switch network of system C

route will show the route added


you also have to specify the other way around on system C routing 
table (if you want to reach system A from system C) 

router needs to connect to the www - so that is why we create a 
default gateway. For any network we dont know the route to, use 
this router as default gateway.
Any request to any network outside of our existingg network goes 
through this particular router.


How to set up a Linux hosts as a router:

- we need to add 2 entries in the routing table of each endpoint

1 for host A to reach network where C is via host B IP
1 for host C to reach network where A is via host B IP
Host B is in both networks 


on Linux packets are not forwarded from 1 eth to the other eth

the forwarding is managed by this path /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

cat it: 0 default (no forward) 

to persist: /etc/sysctl.conf -> 1 


ip link -> list and modify interfaces on the host
ip addr -> see the ip addresses assigned to those interfaces
ip addr add -> set up addresses on interfaces 
route -> routing table
ip route add -> add routing entries 
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - > checks of the host being
utilized as router has forwardng betweeen eths enabled
