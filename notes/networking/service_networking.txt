Service Networking

- services are cluster-wide (they are not node-exclusive) - ClusterIP

- kube-proxy takes care of the services (which dont really exist. THey are just
a virtual object, they dont have any process running nor netowrking interface)

- kube-proxy creates forwarding rules for that service. (iptables)

- iptables -L -t nat | grep service-name

- cat /var/log/kube-proxy.log



To check the IP range for pods you can check the logs for the weave pod (logs of the container):

kubectl -n xxx logs xxxx -c CONTAINER_NAME



Check if kube-proxy is using iptables or other via the logs of the kube-proxy pod
