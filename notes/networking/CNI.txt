Container Network Interface

All the previous steps made to set up network ns is conventional
for all runtimes - Creating the CNI, the standart approach


So a sigle piece of code is in charge of doing all these steps,
its called bridge. it does all required tasks to get a container
to talk to a bridge network.


You can run the program by using: bridge


You can add a container to a particular netns and the program
will take care of every step to do that.


This bridge program is a plugin for CNI basically. the CNI states
how these programs must be developed and how the runtimes should
handle them.



for k8s using docker containers, it creates the containers with
the none network and then manually attaches the cotnainer to a netns
with a plugin.
