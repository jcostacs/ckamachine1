Docker networks

None network

docker run --network none nginx -> the container cant reach anything 
on the outside or other containers other and the same vice versa


Host network

docker run --network host nginx -> the container uses the host network 
interface e. g. if you deploy an app on port 80 on the container then the 
app is also available on the port 80 on the host


Bridge network

docker run nginx -> internal private network is created where the containers
are connected to. Most interesting one. 


When docker is installed on a host it creates its on private network
called Bridge. 
docker network ls 


docker0 is the NI created on the host 

container and netns is the same thing. this netns is created by docker
for that container

Docker creates a pipe with 2 interfaces on each end. One for the netns
and other for the bridge


docker run -p 8080:80 nginx will forward all traffic coming to the host
on port 8080 to port 80 on the netns/container
