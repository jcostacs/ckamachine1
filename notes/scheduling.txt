Scheduling


MAN SCHEDULING


nodeName not assigned by default. k8s adds it automatically. 

Kube looks for the pods with NO nodeName assigned and then assigns it to
the correct node name ( if they exist)

if they dont exist, you need to specify nodeName field (on spec) at pod creation

Manually assign schedules by specifying the nodeName. If its already created
you need to create a binding oject and send a POST request to the pods Binding
API. COnvert yaml to JSON



LABELS N SELECTORS


way of grouping stuff together based on properties and qualities
define labels in  the metadata big section, such as:

metadata:
  labels:
    app: app1
    type: frontend

to select a spefic label we use selectors. not only in manifests for deployments for example,
but also while viewing them using kubectl

kubectl get pods --selector app=app1

annotations are used for metadata itself (info), such as build version, phone numbers etc


MULTIPLE SCHEDULERS

CP from etc/kubernenets/manifests ---- change name, port, leader-elect to false
