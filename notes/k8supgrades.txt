Master nodes upgrade first than the worker nodes

do not skip versions, one minor version at a time 



kubeadm upgrade plan -> does not install or upgrade kubelets



1 - update kubeadm -> apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=X.X.X 

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.X

2 - upgrade kubelet on master node - if exists

apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=X
systemctl restart kubelet



Worker nodes

1 - kubectl drain node1 - DONE ON THE MASTER NODE - after that ssh into the worker node

 afterwards apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.X
            apt-get upgrade -y kubelet+1.X-2
            
            kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.X
            systemctl restart kubelet
            
            kubectl uncordon node1
