Imperative x Declarative
IaC

Imperative means that you specify what to do and how to do it, specifying
the steps to reach a final goal

Declarative means that you will only specify the final goal, and the way to 
achieve that is handled by the infrastricture itself which decides the best
path to do it

 - using the configation files and use kuibetl apply to create, update or
deleting an object
