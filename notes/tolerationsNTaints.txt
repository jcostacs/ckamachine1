Taints are for node configuration

toleration is for pods

Useful if we want to specify which taint accepts what tolerance.
Taints tell the node to only accept the pods with some matching toleration. 

Example: 

TAINT 

 key=value:effect

kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:effect NoSchecdule/NoExecute/PreferNoSchedule


TOLERATIONS

Need pod def file

spec:

  tolerations:
    key: ""
    operator: ""
    value: ""
    effect: ""
